    <h3>Defination of CPU</h3>
    <p>
        A CPU is a computer's centar processing unit. It is a circular board that
        perfoms the basic function of a computer , such as arithematic , logic and
        input/output (I/O). The cpu is the heart of a computer . It is responsible
        for the processing of instruction and data, and for the execution of
        program.

    <h2>CPU components</h2>
    <p>
        <p>01. Primary memory</p>
        <p>02. Secondary memory</p>
        <p>03. Processer</p>
        <p>04. Mother board</p>
        <p>05. Power supply</p>
        <p>06. Cooling system</p>
        <p>07. Grapic card</p>
        <p>08. GPU</p>
    </p>

    <h2> What is primary memory</h2>
    <p>
        Primary memory is the stores  the data that is being processed 
        by the CPU. It is also known as the "working memory". <br>
        primary memory, also known as main memory or RAM (Random Access Memory).

        <h2>What is secondary memory?</h2>
        <p>
            Secondary memory is the memory that stores the instruction that the CPU 
            executes. It is also known as the "program memory". <br>  
            secondary memory , also known as secondary memory or ROM (Read only memory). 
        </p>

        <h2>What is processor</h2>
        <p>
            The processor is the brain of the computer. It is responsible for 
            performing the basic funcition of a computer , such as arithemetic, logic,
            and input/output (I/O). The processor is the heart of a computer . It is 
            resonsible for the processing of instruction and data, and for the 
            execution of programs.
